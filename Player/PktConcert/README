MP3/Player/PktConcert version 0.01
==================================

MP3::Player::PktConcert is a Perl wrapper to the excellent C API to the 
Intel PocketConcert written by John Seagull. This module provides a Perl 
object-oriented API that enables detecting, track management, and memory 
management. John's C API is called libipc. The actual files that the 
library builds are libipkc.a and libipkc.h.

This package was developed on a Linux 2.4.8 kernel, and subsequently that 
is the only known distribution that this package will reliably work on. 
Your mileage may vary, and I would appreciate hearing if you can get this 
package working on your system. It should work on most any modern Linux 
distribution, but I make no guarantees.

Installing this package also assumes that you've installed libipkc and 
its dependency, libusb. Some modifications to libipkc.h may be required 
to get this package working. See the installation notes for more details.

As always, for usage questions, read the perldoc for the module. Thanks, 
and have fun playing with your Intel PocketConcert with Perl!

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

MP3::Player::PktConcert requires the following C libraries, libusb and 
libipc, both available from SourceForge. There is another SourceForge
project with the name 'libipc', which aims to build an Open-Source 
graphical user interface to the Intel Pocket Concert as well as a CLI
specification for custom development. This is not the droid you're
looking for. The libraries are available from the following links:

libipc:
http://www.sourceforge.org/projects/pocketconcert

libusb:
http://www.sourceforge.org/projects/libusb

This package assumes that you have root priveleges to install these
C libraries under /usr/local. Otherwise you may have to modify the
Makefile.PL and *.xs files included with this package to point to
your installation appropriately. 

Modifying your libipkc.h to work in a general case:

The header file libipkc.h, for some reason, has a dependency on a
configuration header, config.h, found with the configure script
(in version 0.4, that would be libipc/config.h). I found that,
after make install, I created /usr/local/include/libipkc and copied
config.h to that path. I then modified libipkc.h's #include directive
to point to that copy of config.h.

After doing that, I could compile my C programs requiring libipkc.h
by telling gcc -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib without error.
